# Product Overview

## Jal Dhwani - The Acoustic Water-Policy Engine

"Shazam for Water Pumps" - An edge-AI device that prevents groundwater over-extraction and ensures community fairness in rural India.

**Competition Track**: AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact

## Problem Statement

India is running out of groundwater. Farmers over-irrigate because they can't see underground water levels, and there's no mechanism to ensure fair water distribution across communities. Existing soil moisture sensors are expensive (₹5,000+), fragile, and get destroyed by tractors/corrosion. More critically, they don't address community-level resource fairness.

## Solution

Non-invasive acoustic monitoring system that clips onto existing water pumps. Uses vibration analysis to detect resource depletion and employs Generative AI to balance individual farmer needs with community fairness, considering pump health, weather forecasts, and village-wide water usage patterns.

## Target Users

- Primary: Farmers with existing water pumps
- Secondary: FPO (Farmer Producer Organizations) and Panchayat administrators
- Scale: Rural India, focusing on groundwater-stressed regions
- Impact: Community-level water equity and resource sustainability

## Key Features

1. Resource Depletion Detection: Acoustic monitoring detects well depletion to prevent motor burnout and resource exhaustion
2. Community-Aware AI Scheduling: AWS Bedrock balances individual irrigation needs with village-wide fairness
3. Voice-First Alerts: Farmers receive calls in local languages explaining pump actions and community impact
4. Community Dashboard: Village-wide water stress heatmaps showing fairness metrics
5. Zero-Internet Edge Protection: Offline AI ensures safety even without connectivity

## Domain Terminology

- Resource Depletion: Well water level dropping below sustainable threshold (detected via acoustic signatures)
- Acoustic Emission (AE): Vibration/sound analysis technique
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform): Signal processing to isolate pump frequencies
- Community Fairness: Equitable water distribution across village farmers
- FPO: Farmer Producer Organization
- Panchayat: Village-level administrative body
- Public Impact: Measurable improvement in community water equity and sustainability

## Differentiation

- Non-invasive: Clips onto pump casing (no in-ground sensors)
- Retrofit design: Works with existing pumps, 2-minute installation
- Ultra-low cost: ₹700 per unit vs ₹5,000 for competitors
- Community-First AI: Balances individual needs with village-wide fairness, not just individual optimization
- Public Impact Focus: Designed for equitable resource access across communities
