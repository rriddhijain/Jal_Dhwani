# Product Overview

## Jal Dhwani - The Acoustic Water-Policy Engine

"Shazam for Water Pumps" - An edge-AI device that prevents groundwater over-extraction in rural India.

## Problem Statement

India is running out of groundwater. Farmers over-irrigate because they can't see underground water levels. Existing soil moisture sensors are expensive (₹5,000+), fragile, and get destroyed by tractors/corrosion.

## Solution

Non-invasive acoustic monitoring system that clips onto existing water pumps. Uses vibration analysis to detect well depletion (cavitation) and employs Generative AI to automate irrigation based on pump health + weather forecasts.

## Target Users

- Primary: Farmers with existing water pumps
- Secondary: FPO (Farmer Producer Organizations) and Panchayat administrators
- Scale: Rural India, focusing on groundwater-stressed regions

## Key Features

1. Acoustic Dry-Run Protection: Detects cavitation to prevent motor burnout
2. Generative Irrigation Plans: AI-driven scheduling via AWS Bedrock
3. Voice-First Alerts: Farmers receive calls in local languages explaining pump actions
4. Community Dashboard: Village-wide water stress heatmaps for administrators
5. Zero-Internet Edge Protection: Auto-cutoff works offline for safety

## Domain Terminology

- Cavitation: Air bubbles in pump when well runs dry (causes damage)
- Acoustic Emission (AE): Vibration/sound analysis technique
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform): Signal processing to isolate pump frequencies
- Dry-Running: Pump operating without sufficient water
- FPO: Farmer Producer Organization
- Panchayat: Village-level administrative body

## Differentiation

- Non-invasive: Clips onto pump casing (no in-ground sensors)
- Retrofit design: Works with existing pumps, 2-minute installation
- Ultra-low cost: ₹700 per unit vs ₹5,000 for competitors
- Agentic AI: Takes autonomous action, not just monitoring
