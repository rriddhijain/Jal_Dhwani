Jal-Dhwani: The Acoustic Water-Policy Engine 🌊🔊
"Shazam for Water Pumps"
Track: AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact

Project for: AI for Bharat Hackathon 2026

Vision
Jal-Dhwani is an edge-AI acoustic monitoring system that prevents groundwater over-extraction. We replace expensive, fragile soil sensors with a ₹50 piezoelectric sensor that "listens" to pump vibrations to detect cavitation (dry-running).

The Agentic Brain
Edge: ESP32-S3 performs real-time FFT frequency analysis to detect pump health locally.

Cloud: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) synthesizes pump data with live weather forecasts to automate irrigation schedules.

Action: Amazon Polly triggers voice calls to farmers in local languages explaining pump state.
